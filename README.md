# CMake-Template
My custom simple CMake Template. I'm lazy, so this template is for me (and others if they want) to download.
This template is fairly simple and very basic, as I mentioned I use it when I want to fast and easly make new project.


## CreateCMake files
### `./setupCmake.sh`
## Build (compile) project
### `./compile.sh`
## Run project
### `./run.sh`
